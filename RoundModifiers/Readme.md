# RoundModifiers Plugin

This SCP:SL EXILED plugin introduces a variety of gameplay modifiers to spice up your rounds. Players can vote on their preferred modifier, or admins can directly assign them for maximum chaos!

## Available Modifiers

* **Blackout:** The lights go out, plunging the facility into darkness.
* **FriendlyFire:** Watch your fire! Friendly fire is enabled. 
* **Imposter:** SCPs walk among you, disguised as humans. Can you root out the imposters?
* **Insurrection:**  Facility Guards will spawn as Chaos Insurgents, changing the balance of power.
* **LevelUp:**  Players can level up during the round, gaining stat boosts and abilities.
* **MicroHID:**  Be careful with the MicroHID – it now drains your health with each use.
* **MultiBall:**  SCP-018 goes wild! Lockers are full of them, and thrown balls spawn even more.
* **NoDecontamination:**  Decontamination is disabled, replaced by a slow but steady damage effect.
* **NoKOS:**  Class-D and Scientists become unkillable (unless holding illegal items), getting arrested when shot.
* **NoSCP914:**  SCP-914 is out of commission. Time to find new upgrade strategies.
* **Puppies:**  Even the SCPs aren't immune to cuteness! All SCPs are now adorable (but still dangerous) miniature SCP-939s.
* **RadioSilent:**  Communication is key, but not today. Players cannot use their radios.
* **Rainbow:**  The facility turns into a disco! Lights continuously change colors.
* **RandomSpawnSize:**  Players spawn at random sizes – expect some hilarious (and strategic) consequences.
* **RogueAI:**  An unpredictable AI roams the halls, randomly aiding or hindering players depending on the current game state.
* **SCP249:**  Watch out! SCP-249 (the teleporting door) has decided to wreak havoc on the facility.
